## Description

This project uses data from MBTA to track bus stops from MIT to Harvard.
I updated updated the styles of the map using Mapbox styles editor.


### How to run:
To run this file first download the root folder from github. 
 - Visit [mapbox.com](http://www.mapbox.com) and get your own access token. 
 - Copy/paste the token into the index.html file. 
 - Drag and drop in index.html page into any web browser. 


## My process

I received data on bus stop locations from MBTA. When the button is clicked, javascript iterates over the locations and displays them on the map.

### Built with

- [MapBox](mapbox.com) - JavaScript library


### What I learned

I learned about maps and Mapbox.


```js
let map = new mapboxgl.Map({
  container: 'map',
  style: 'mapbox://styles/emday4prez/cl475f05a000015usq1d69d7e',
  center: [-71.104081, 42.365554],
  zoom: 14,
});
```


### Continued development

I would like to earn more experience working with APIs in JavaScript.
